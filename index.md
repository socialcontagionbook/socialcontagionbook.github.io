# Abstracts

## **Part 1**: _Introduction to spreading in social systems_

### <a name="centola"></a> Damon Centola: _TBD_

### <a name="dodds1"></a> Peter Sheridan Dodds: _Understanding the global spreading condition for simple models of spreading_

This chapter lays out how the the condition for global spreading from a single
seed can be derived in a physically clear way in core random network models.
Should create a framework for how researchers approach more complex kinds of
spreading on real-world networks.  The line of thinking will apply for
generalized random networks, bipartite networks, temporal networks, and
multilayered networks.

## **Part 2**: _Models and Theories_

### <a name="gleeson"></a> James Gleeson and Mason Porter: _Message-passing methods for complex contagions_

Message-passing methods can be applied to calculate the expected size of
cascades both on random networks (e.g. drawn from the configuration model
ensemble) and on specific finite networks (e.g. Shrestha and Moore PRE 2014,
Lokhov et al. PRE 2015). We review the message-passing approach and show how it
can be easily derived for configuration model networks using the methods of
(Gleeson PRE 2008, Dhar J. Phys A 1997). Using this approach, we explain how
the analytical "cascade condition" is determined for such cases. We extend this
approach to the message-passing methods for specific finite networks, and
derive the generalized cascade condition that determines whether a global
cascade will occur on a given network. To provide context, we'll also indicate
briefly other types of insights that message-passing methods can give and
discuss limitations of the approach.

### <a name="dodds2"></a> Peter Sheridan Dodds: _Generalized contagion: Unifying simple models of social and biological spreading_

Present and motivate the generalized contagion model originally introduced by
Dodds and Watts in 2004. Give a cleaner explanation of the global spreading
condition that was originally put forward.


### <a name="nematzadeh"></a>Azadeh Nematzadeh, Nathaniel Rodriguez, Alessandro Flammini, and Yong-Yeol Ahn: _Optimal modularity in complex contagion_

In this chapter, we apply the theoretical framework introduced in the previous chapter to study the impact of modularity in the spreading of complex contagion. In particular, we focus on the phenomenon of optimal modularity, where global cascade occurs when the network exhibit just the right amount of modularity. Here we further generalize the original finding by investigating the case where there are multiple communities and the seeds are randomly distributed across the network. Then we also provide insights into the temporal aspects of the optimal modularity phenomenon. 


### <a name="holme"></a> Petter Holme: _Probing empirical contact networks by simulation of spreading dynamics_

In this chapter, we will review the methods and techniques to understand the
role of temporal and topological structures on spreading phenomena. We survey
randomization techniques and the subtle issues when adapting compartmental or
threshold models to temporal networks. We furthermore discuss how to best
represent contact data as static networks. Finally, we go through some of the
general results of such studies.

### <a name="pei"></a>Sen Pei, Flaviano Morone, and Hernan Makse: _Influencer identification in complex networks_

In social and biological systems, the structural heterogeneity of interaction
networks gives rise to the emergence of a small set of influential nodes, or
influencers, in a series of dynamical processes. Although much smaller than the
entire network, these influencers were observed to be able to shape the
collective dynamics of large populations in different contexts. As such, the
successful identification of influencers should have profound implications in
various real-world spreading dynamics such as viral marketing, epidemic
outbreaks and cascading failure. In this chapter, we first summarize the
centrality-based approach in finding single influencers in complex networks,
and then discuss the more complicated problem of locating multiple influencers
from a collective point of view. Progress rooted in collective influence
theory, belief-propagation and computer science will be presented. Finally, we
present some applications of influencer identification in diverse real-world
systems, including online social platform, scientific publication, brain
network and socioeconomic system.

## **Part 3**: _Observational studies_

### Ciro Cattuto and Alain Barrat: _TBD_

### <a name="iniguez"></a>Gerardo Iñiguez, Kimmo Kaski, János Kertész and Márton Karsai: _Service adoption spreading in online social networks_

Adoption of innovations, products or online services is commonly interpreted as
a spreading process that is arguably driven by social influence, external
effects of media, and conditioned by the needs and capacities of individuals.
Observations of such processes date back to the seminal studies of Rogers and
Bass, and their modelling has taken two directions: One paradigm, called simple
contagion, identifies adoption spreading similar to epidemic processes, while
the other, named complex contagion, is concerned with behavioural thresholds,
and successfully explains global adoption cascades commonly observed in real
Data. The observation of real service adoption processes has become easier
lately due to the availability of large digital social network and behavioural
datasets. This has allowed the simultaneous study of network structure and
ongoing service adoption dynamics, which has shed light on various mechanisms
and external effects influencing the dynamics of global adoption. These
advancements have induced the development of more realistic models of social
spreading phenomena, which in turn have provided remarkably good predictions of
real adoption cases. In this chapter we first review recent data-driven studies
addressing real cases of service adoption processes. Then we study the
modelling of such phenomena with formal methods and data-driven simulations.
Our objective is to understand the effects of identified social mechanisms on
the final outcome of service adoption spreading, and to provide potential new
directions and open questions for future research.

### <a name="quattrociocchi"></a> Walter Quattrociocchi: _(Mis)information spreading on Facebook_

The diffusion of false claims on social media as well as the pivotal role of
confirmation bias in informational cascades are among the most important topics
addressed by computational social science.  In this chapter, by focusing on
both Italian and US Facebook users interacting with two different and
contrasting narratives (involving scientific and conspiracy-like information),
we provide quantitative evidence of the existence and emergence of echo
chambers on online social media. Confirmation bias dominates spreading
processes and define group of interests where users crystalize their beliefs.
Our findings, indeed, show the users’ tendency to select information that is
coherent to their system of beliefs and to form segregated groups of
like-minded people where they reinforce and polarize their pre-existing
beliefs. We offer empirical evidence that confirmatory information gets
accepted even when containing deliberately false claims, while dissenting
information is mainly ignored. The interaction within like-minded people seems
to negatively influences users’ emotions and to increase group polarization.
Finally, we provide evidence that misinformation cascades might be linked to
highly polarizing topics fomenting hated debates online.


### <a name="hui"></a>Pikmai Hui, Lilian Weng, Alireza Sahami, YY Ahn, Filippo Menczer: _Predicting viral memes_

We investigate the predictability of successful memes using their early
spreading patterns in the underlying social networks. We show that community
concentration is a predictor of virality. Our methods scale up to very large
networks and our findings generalize to multiple platforms (Twitter and
Tumblr).

### <a name="weng"></a> Lilian Weng, Márton Karsai, Nicola Perra, Filippo Menczer, Alessandro Flammini: _Attention on Weak Ties in Social and Communication Networks_

We present empirical support for both of Granovetter's weak tie hypotheses: (1)
strong social ties carry the large majority of interaction events; (2) weak
social ties are often relevant for the exchange of especially important
information. We show that attention is high on weak ties but also on very
strong ties. Data from online social media and mobile communication reveal
network-dependent mixtures of these two effects on the basis of a platform's
typical usage. See also: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02399

### <a name="ferrara"></a> Emilio Ferrara: _Measuring the effect of social bots on information diffusion in social media_

Social bots have been playing a crucial role in online platform ecosystems, as
efficient and automatic tools to generate content and diffuse information to
the social media human population. In this chapter, I will discuss the role of
social bots in content spreading dynamics in social media. I will investigate,
in particular, the difference between diffusion dynamics of content generated
by bots, as opposed to humans, in the context of political and other types of
social media campaigns. 

### <a name="bollen"></a> Johan Bollen and Bruno Goncalves: _Network Happiness: How Social Interactions Impact our Well Being_

As social animals, we rely on our communities to support and sustain us. As a
result, our social interactons play a fundamental role in how we live our lives
and in shaping our emotional states and general well being. The recent
developments in Online Social Networks have allowed us to, for the first time,
have an extensive detailed record of a well defined subset of our social
structures and behaviors.  In this chapter we review several recent results on
the structure of the social networks of which we are all a part of. In
particular we will analyze how simple mechanisms of network formation such as
Preferential Attachement result in the broad tailed degree distributions and
assortativity that are characteristic of this kind of networks. A result of
positive degree assortativity is the fact that hubs are tendentially connected
to by lower degree nodes, a fact that has become known as the Friendship
Paradox. Finally, we consider as well a mesure of Subjective Well Being through
an analysis of the content written by each user over an extended period of
time. We find that Happiness is correlated with popularity within the network
resulting also in a Happiness Paradox 

### <a name="bagrow"></a>James P Bagrow: _Examining human dynamics by contrasting normal and anomalous activities during normal and anomalous events_

Essentially, the goal is to describe work where we can use emergency events
compared with normal events to better understand what people are doing, how
better understanding normal activity helps us understand anomalous activity and
vice versa, and how contrasting the two is helpful for this. I will discuss the
emergency paper I did, present some other data mining for emergencies work I
have left, perhaps review some other work people have done on Twitter during
events, etc. I have a result about the friendship paradox that may be able to
go in as well.

### J Niels Rosenquist: _TBD_

## **Part 4**: _Controlled studies_

### <a name="taylor"></a>Sean Taylor: _Measuring Social Influence with Randomized Experiments_

Measurements of the effects of social influence can be substantially biased in
observational studies due to assortative mixing in social networks and network
correlation in exposure to exogenous events. Randomized experiments, where the
researcher intervenes in the social system and uses randomization to determine
how to do so, provide a methodology to measure unbiased estimates of causal
effects of social behaviors. These estimates form the basis for effective
public policy and advertising, as well as help answer deep questions about
social science.  In this chapter we motivate a taxonomy of experiments to
measure social influence effects through various combinations of interventions
and randomizations. We define an experiment as combination of 1) a target
population of individuals connected by an observed interaction network, 2) a
set of treatments whereby the researcher will intervene in the social system,
3) a randomization strategy which maps sets of individuals or edges to
treatments, and 4) a measurement of an outcome of interest after treatment has
been assigned. We review both recent and older research which demonstrate
potential experimental designs and evaluate their advantages and drawbacks for
answering different types of causal questions about social influence.

### <a name="pentland"></a> Yan Leng, Xiaowen Dong, and Alex Pentland: _Mapping Behavior Influence using Matched and Balanced Samples_

Causal inference is a difficult problem that is best understood within a
Kolmogorov complexity framework. Taking this perspective illuminates the
shortcomings of techniques like Randomized Controlled Trials, and suggests
techniques such as matched or balanced sampling may often be more powerful and
are often easier to use for large population studies.  We illustrate this work
in two cellphone based studies where we track the behavioral effects of
exposure within a social network.

### <a name="bond"></a> Robert Bond, Chris Fariss, Jason Jones, Jaime Settle: _Network Experiments through Academic-Industry Collaboration_

Our main goal in this chapter is to summarize and describe our work on
get-out-the-vote experiments run on the Facebook social media platform.  We ran
randomized experiments and observed both direct effects – a message on Election
Day made Facebook users more likely to vote – and cascading effects in the
social network – the friends of treated users became more likely to vote.
Collaborating with Facebook vastly increased the scope of our research project
from what we originally planned.  We will also discuss why academic
collaboration with industry is not only important in general, but particularly
important for understanding complex social systems.  We will conclude with a
discussion of some of the opportunities we see for scientific advancement in
this area.
